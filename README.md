# Telecom Churn Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and mitigating customer churn in the telecom sector. By leveraging SQL Server for data management, Power BI for visualization, and Python for machine learning, it delivers actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Analyze Customer Data**:
  - Demographic
  - Geographic
  - Payment and Account Information
  - Services
- **Study Churn Profiles**:
  - Identify key areas for targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Predict Future Churners**:
  - Implement predictive modeling to classify potential churners.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**:
  - Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
  - Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Power BI**:
  - Interactive dashboards to visualize customer metrics and churn rates.
- **Python**:
  - Random Forest algorithm for churn prediction.

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Data Management with SQL Server
- **Setup Database**:
  - Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
- **ETL Process**:
  - Import raw data into staging tables.
  - Clean data (handle null values, adjust datatypes).
  - Populate production tables.
- **Views for Reporting**:
  - Focus on churned, stayed, and new customers.

### 2. Visualization with Power BI
- **Transform Data**:
  - Add derived columns (e.g., Churn Status, Monthly Charge Range).
  - Group data by Age, Tenure, and other relevant factors.
- **Dashboards**:
  - Summary page with churn metrics.
  - Detailed breakdown by demographics, accounts, and services.

### 3. Machine Learning with Python
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
- **Train Random Forest Classifier**:
  - Evaluate with confusion matrix and feature importance.
- **Predict Churn**:
  - Apply model on new customer data.

### 4. Insights
- Identify key factors driving churn.
- Enable targeted campaigns to retain at-risk customers.

## 📈 Results and Impact
- Improved understanding of churn patterns.
- Enhanced decision-making using data-driven insights.
- Proactive measures for customer retention.


### Tech Stack used: 
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - For database management and ETL processes.
- Power BI Desktop - For data visualization and dashboard creation
- Python with Jupyter Notebook (Install via Anaconda) -For data preprocessing, machine learning, and predictive modeling.


## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
- Automate ETL workflows.
- Integrate real-time data streaming.
